# MMTAdmobSample
Example of how to use [MMTAdmobSample](https://github.com/marcojak/MauiMTAdmob) with [NET8](https://puresourcecode.com/tag/net8/). My focus is on the iOS version and in particular on rewarded advertisement. The first reward is displayed but the following is not.

## Steps

### First example

- Open the example app
- Tap on **Load** the reward
- Tap on **Show** the reward
- Waiting and closing the reward
- Tap on **Load** the reward again
- Tap on **Show** the reward -> not displaying

### Second example

- Open the example app
- Tap on **Load** the reward
- Tap on **Show** the reward
- Waiting and closing the reward
- Tap on **Show** the reward -> not displaying

## Video

As you can see in the video, the first reward is displayed but after that no one is displayed. Only if I close the app and open it again, the reward is displayed again.
